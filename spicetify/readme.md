# Spicetify Backup

This repository contains my personalized Spicetify backup configuration, featuring a minimalist and beautiful setup. It includes a fullscreen extension and support for lyrics display.

## Installation

1. Install **Spotify Backup by Ohitstom** from the **Marketplace**.
2. Reload the Spotify app.
3. Open **Marketplace settings** and navigate to **Backup/Restore**.
4. Import `spotify-backup.json`.
5. You're all set!

## Features & Usage

- **Fullscreen Mode**: I have pre-configured the **Fullscreen Extension by daksh2k**. Simply press `F` to toggle fullscreen mode on and off.
- **Minimalist & Beautiful UI**: The configuration is designed to be clean and visually appealing.
- **Lyrics Display**: To enable lyrics, install the `lyrics-plus` custom app using the following command:

  ```sh
  spicetify config custom_apps lyrics-plus
  spicetify apply
  ```

Enjoy your enhanced Spotify experience! ðŸŽµ

## Notes
- Ensure Spicetify is installed and set up correctly before applying this backup.
