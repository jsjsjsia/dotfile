How can I help you today?\n\nzed\n\n\"Zed\" is a pretty common name/word, so I'll need some context to give you a useful answer.  What about \"Zed\" are you interested in?  For example, are you asking about:\n\n* **A person named Zed?**  Is there a specific Zed you're looking for information about?\n* **The letter Z?**  Sometimes Z is pronounced \"Zed\" in certain English dialects.\n* **A character from a game, movie, or book?**  There are many fictional characters named Zed.  Which one are you thinking of?  (e.g., Zed from League of Legends)\n* **Something else entirely?**  Is there another meaning or context you had in mind?\n\n\nTell me more, and I'll do my best to help!\n\nhow to change zed code editor icon\n\n\n\nYou can't directly change the Zed editor icon in the traditional sense of replacing the application icon itself.  Zed is a web-based editor that runs in your browser.  Therefore, the icon you see is determined by the browser or your operating system's handling of web applications.\n\nHowever, you can do a few things to influence how Zed appears on your system:\n\n1. **Create a Desktop Shortcut (Most Effective):**  This will give you a dedicated icon on your desktop.  The exact steps depend on your operating system and browser:\n\n   * **Chrome/Edge/Brave (Chromium-based browsers):**\n     1. Open Zed in your browser.\n     2. Click the three vertical dots (menu) in the upper right corner.\n     3. Go to \"More tools\" and select \"Create shortcut...\".\n     4. Optionally, check the \"Open as window\" box. This will launch Zed in its own dedicated window, separate from the browser's main interface, making it feel more like a standalone application.\n     5. Click \"Create.\"\n\n   * **Firefox:**\n     1. Open Zed in your browser.\n     2. Right-click on a blank area of the tab.\n     3. Select \"This Frame\" then \"Add shortcut to desktop\"\n   * **Other Browsers:**  The process is generally similar. Look for options to create a shortcut or web app.\n\n2. **Pin to Taskbar/Dock (For quick access):**  Once you have a desktop shortcut, you can usually right-click and pin it to your taskbar (Windows) or dock (macOS) for faster access.\n\n3. **Use a Different Browser Profile (Less Common):**  If you use browser profiles, you could associate a specific profile with Zed and give that profile a custom icon.  However, this is usually overkill for just changing an editor's icon.\n\n4. **Browser Extensions (Potentially, but unlikely):** There might be browser extensions that allow more customization of web app icons, but this is not a standard feature and finding a reliable extension for this specific purpose is unlikely.\n\nBy creating a desktop shortcut and optionally opening it as a window, you'll effectively have a Zed \"icon\" that launches the editor quickly and, with the windowed option, gives it a more standalone app feel.\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":244}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":6,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":245}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":43,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":246}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":36},"start":48,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":247}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":37},"start":682,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":248}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":109},"start":717,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"error during streamGenerateContent, status code: 429, body: {\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": 429,\n    \"message\": \"Resource has been exhausted (e.g. check quota).\",\n    \"status\": \"RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED\"\n  }\n}\n"},"timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":249}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":110},"start":719,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":250}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":133},"start":720,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":251}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":134},"start":2840,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":252}}}],"summary":"Brief Empty Exchange ","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
